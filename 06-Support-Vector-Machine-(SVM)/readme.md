# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## What is SVM?
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane or decision boundary that separates the classes of data points with the maximum margin. In the case of two-dimensional data, the hyperplane is a line that divides the data points of different classes better as possible.
