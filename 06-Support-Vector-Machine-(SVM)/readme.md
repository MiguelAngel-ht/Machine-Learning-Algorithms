# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## What is SVM?

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane or decision boundary that separates the classes of data points with the maximum margin. In the case of two-dimensional data, the hyperplane is a line that divides the data points of different classes better as possible.



## Maths Involved in This Algorithm

The fundamental idea behind SVM is to find the optimal hyperplane which maximizes the margin between two classes. The equation of the hyperplane is represented as:

$\overrightarrow{\omega} \cdot \overrightarrow{x} - b =0$

where $\overrightarrow{\omega}$ is the normal vector to the hyperplane, $\overrightarrow{x}$ are the input features, and $b$ is the bias. The objective is to minimize

$\frac{1}{2} \left\| \overrightarrow{\omega}\right\| {^2}$


## Where Can I Use This Algorithm for Solving Problems?

* Text classification problems such as spam detection, sentiment analysis.
* Image classification for handwriting recognition, facial recognition, etc.
* In bioinformatics, for protein classification, cancer classification.
* In financial sectors for stock market price trend forecasting.
