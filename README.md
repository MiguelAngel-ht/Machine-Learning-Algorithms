## Introduction

 Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves teaching computers to learn from data, rather than being explicitly programmed. It operates by constructing algorithms that, after being exposed to training data, can make predictions or decisions without direct human intervention. Initially, ML tackled simple problems, like sorting data or recognizing patterns in numbers. However, its early applications were predominantly in domains such as handwriting recognition or basic game playing.

Fast forward to today, and ML has permeated nearly every sector. In the real world, it drives advancements in areas ranging from healthcare, where algorithms can detect diseases, to finance, optimizing stock market trading strategies. While its early days saw solutions for narrower tasks, modern ML, especially with the rise of deep learning, addresses complex challenges: translating languages in real-time, driving autonomous vehicles, generating art, and even aiding in cutting-edge scientific research.
