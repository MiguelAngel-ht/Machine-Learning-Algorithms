# Neural Networks: FFNN and RNN


## FFNN (Feedforward Neural Networks)

Feedforward Neural Networks, or FFNNs, are the simplest form of neural networks. In these networks, information moves only in one direction: forward from the input layers, through hidden layers, and finally to the output layer. There are no cycles or loops in these networks, making them architecturally straightforward.

### Implementation with TensorFlow and Keras
TensorFlow and Keras make it easy to create FFNN models with their intuitive and flexible API. You can define layers, activation functions, training processes, and more with just a few lines of code.

### Applications
- Image classification
- Fraud detection
- Time series predictions (basic)
- Recommendation systems

## RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)

Recurrent Neural Networks, or RNNs, are a class of neural networks ideal for processing sequences and time series data. Unlike FFNNs, RNNs have feedback connections that allow them to process not only the current input but also the information received previously.

### Implementation with TensorFlow and Keras
Implementing RNNs with TensorFlow and Keras is equally accessible. Keras provides specific layers like `SimpleRNN`, `LSTM`, and `GRU` that are fundamental for building recurrent networks.

### Applications
- Natural language processing
- Voice recognition
- Time series analysis
- Music generation

## FFNN üÜö RNN

| Feature | FFNN | RNN |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Information Flow | Unidirectional | With feedback (temporal) |
| Sequence Handling | Not suitable for sequences | Designed for sequences and time series |
| Complexity | Simpler | More complex (handling temporal dependencies) |

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### FFNN
- **‚úÖ Advantages**: Simplicity, effectiveness in linear problems, easy to train.
- **‚ùå Disadvantages**: Not suitable for sequential data, limited in complexity and expressiveness.

### RNN
- **‚úÖ Advantages**: Excellent for sequential data, can handle variable-length sequences, powerful for capturing temporal dependencies.
- **‚ùå Disadvantages**: More difficult to train (vanishing gradient problems), computationally more intensive.
